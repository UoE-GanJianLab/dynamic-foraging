#### Figure 5

1. Panel A B C D

The A B panels are for PFC firing that positively or negatively correlated with prpd/relative values. The C D panels are for DMS firing that positively or negatively correlated with prpd/relative values. The top panel is the raster plot with the data organized as follows:

|trial_index|relative_spike_time|
|---|---|
|trial index|relative spike time to cue time|

The bottom panel is the average firing rate(20ms bins) across all trials against the relative time to cue time with the data organized as follows:

|bin_centers|left_p_high|right_p_high|
|---|---|---|
|center of the 20ms bin|average firing rate across trials with hign left reward probability|average firing rate across trials with hign right reward probability|

2. Panel E

Panel E has a pair of pie charts showing the percentage of PFC and DMS cells that are correlated with PRPD/relative values. Each pie chart is split into four parts: not-correlated, only ITI firing correlated, only response magnitude correlated, both ITI firing and response magnitude correlated. The data are organized as follows:

#### Figure 6

1. Panel B
The data for panel b are split into two groups, one done with prpd, one with relative values from the reinforcement learning models. The data are organized as follows:

|trial_index|pfc_mag_standardized|dms_mag_standardized|prpd_standardized|pfc_mag_filtered|dms_mag_filtered|prpd_filtered|pfc_phase|dms_phase|prpd_phase|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

The pairs here are filtered by removing cells that are suspected to have experienced probe drift to reduce the amount of resulting images to go through. The filtering is done by removing cells with no firing in 10 consecutive trials in the response time window.

2. Panel C

Panel C shows the discretized mean phase difference between PFC and DMS pairs split by session performance. The bins range from $[-\pi, \pi]$ with 36 bins.

|bin_center|good response count|good bg count|bad response count|bad bg count|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|center of the bin|number of good session PFC DMS pairs whose mean phase difference of response window firing falls into the bin|number of good session PFC DMS pairs whose mean phase difference of background firing falls into the bin|number of bad session PFC DMS pairs whose mean phase difference of response window firing falls into the bin|number of bad session PFC DMS pairs whose mean phase difference of background firing falls into the bin|

3. Panel D

Panel C shows the discretized mean phase difference between PFC/DMS cells during reponse/ITI windows and PRPD. The data are organized as follows:

|bin_center|pfc_response_count|pfc_bg_count|dms_response_count|dms_bg_count|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|center of the bin|number of PFC cells whose mean phase difference with PRPD during response window falls into the bin|number of PFC cells whose mean phase difference with PRPD during ITI window falls into the bin|number of DMS cells whose mean phase difference with PRPD during response window falls into the bin|number of DMS cells whose mean phase difference with PRPD during ITI window falls into the bin|


#### Figure 7

* Panel B

This is a pie chart showing the percentage of PRPD modulated cell pairs out of all the mono cell pairs. Similar to figure 5 panel E, the pie chart is split into four parts: not-correlated, only ITI firing correlated, only response magnitude correlated, both ITI firing and response magnitude correlated. The data are organized as follows:

|correlation|percentage|
|---|---|
|one of the four types of correlation|percentage of cell pairs that are correlated with the corresponding type|

#### Figure 8

Figure 8 focus on the interconnectivity strength, calculated using the maximum absolute deviation from 0 of the normalized cross correlation between the pair of DMS and PFC firring during ITI.

The normalized cross correlation $\'x(\tau)$ between two time series $g(t), h(t)$ is calculated using:

$$\'x(\tau)=\frac{x(\tau)-E[x(\tau)]}{E[x(\tau)]}$$

Where:

$$x(\tau)=\sum^N_{t=-N}g(t)h(t+\tau)$$

$$E[x(\tau)]=\sum^N_{t=-N}\bar{g}(t)\bar{h}(t+\tau)$$

$\bar{g}(t)$ is a time series with equal length to $g(t)$, where each time point equals $\bar{g(t)}$, the mean of $g(t)$. Same applies to $h(t)$.

To adjust for the sudden variations in the firing rates, the interconnectivity stength for each trial is calculated using a centered 20-trial long window. The binned firing rates(10ms) from 1 second before the first trial initiation till the last trial initiation in the 20-trial window of the corresponding DMS and PFC cells are the $g(t)$ and $h(t)$ in the above equations.

1. Panel A B C

Panel A B C shows the interconnectivity strength between PFC and DMS pairs, prior reward proportion of the corresponding session and the correlation between interconnectivity strength(max absolute normalized cross correlation) and discretized prior reward proportion respectively. The data are organized as follows:

* Panel A

|trial_index|interconnectivity_strength|
|---|---|
|trial index|interconnectivity strength between PFC and DMS(max absolute normalized cross correlation)|

* Panel B

|trial_index|reward_proportion|
|---|---|
|trial index|prior reward proportion of each session|

* Panel C

|discretized_reward_proportion|interconnectivity_strength_mean|interconnectivity_strength_err|
|---|---|---|
|discretized prior reward proportion|mean interconnectivity strength between PFC and DMS pairs|standard error of the mean interconnectivity strength between PFC and DMS pairs|

#### Beri-Cohen Extra

To rebate the reviewer's comment on influence of past and future choices, we plotted the firing rate of PFC and DMS cells against the relative value/prpd, split into past and future choices. The data are organized as follows:

## Reinforcement Learning Modelling

In addition to the intuitive PRPD. reinforcement learning modelling was also utilized in this study. The Rescorla Wagner model common in non-stationary two-arm bandit tasks was chosen to be a suitable candidate.

The model (sometimes referred to as the Q-learning model in other publications)'s decision is guided by two decision variables, associated with two choices given to the animals. In our case, $Q_l$ corresponds to leftward choices, while $Q_r$ corresponds to the right. They were fed into the softmax function, along with a bias term $b$ and inverse temperature parameter $\beta$ to produce the probability of making a rightward choice.

$$
\begin{aligned}P_r&=\frac{e^{\beta\cdot Q_r}}{e^{\beta\cdot Q_r}+e^{\beta\cdot Q_l+b}} \cr
&=\frac{1}{1+e^{-\beta(Q_r-Q_l)+b}}\end{aligned}
$$


The second equation is the result of dividing both the numerator and denominator by $e^{\beta\cdot Q_r}$, and is actually used in the optimization process.

After each trial, the model updates the decision variables using the following equations:

$$
\begin{aligned}\delta&=r-Q_{choice}\cr
Q_{choice}&=Q_{choice}+\alpha\cdot\delta\cr
Q_{non-choice}&=Q_{non-choice}\end{aligned}
$$

Where $\delta$ is the prediction error, $r$ is the reward received, $Q_{choice}$ is the decision variable associated with the chosen side, $Q_{non-choice}$ is the decision variable associated with the chosen by the animals, and $\alpha$ is the learning rate.

The optimization process aims to minimize the negative log-likelihood of the model's choice probability given the actual choices made by the animals. The negative log-likelihood is calculated using the following equation:

$$
NLL=-\sum_{i=1}^{n}log(P_{i})
$$

Where $n$ is the number of trials, $P_{r_i}$ is the probability of making the animal's choice at trial $i$. The optimization process is handled by Python's Scipy package, using the Nelder-Mead method of the minimize function. The optimization process was repeated 100 times for each session, with the initial parameters randomly sampled from a uniform distribution to avoid local minima as much as possible.

The parameters were bounded to the following ranges:

|Parameter|Lower Bound|Upper Bound|
|---|---|---|
|$\beta$|0.1|$\infty$|
|$\alpha$|0.001|1|
|$b$|$-\infty$|$\infty$|
